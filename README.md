Hello, my name is Carlos Eduardo da Silva (Kdu71).
I have a degree in Information Technology from FAETERJ.
I have professional experience in networks and programming with C#, but academically, I have developed work in C, C++, Java, PHP, Python and Kotlin.
I also have good knowledge of SQL, mainly in the construction of procedures.
I am currently dedicating myself to Front-End Develope  and will use this repository to showcase my creations, as I seek to work as a Freelancer.
